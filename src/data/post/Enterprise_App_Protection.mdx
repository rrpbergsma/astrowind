## 🛠️ How It Works

When you visit a website or open an email, Enterprise App Protection **automatically scans all links** and determines if they are safe:

1️⃣ **Identifies mentions of enterprise applications** (like "Microsoft 365" or "DocuSign") in links.  
2️⃣ **Checks if links point to the official domain** or an **impersonation site**.  
3️⃣ **Uses Google Safe Browsing API** to detect additional phishing and malware threats.  
4️⃣ **Monitors dynamic content in Outlook Web, Teams, and SharePoint**, ensuring links added after page load are also checked.

If a phishing attempt is found, a **warning is shown directly below the link**, alerting you before you click.
